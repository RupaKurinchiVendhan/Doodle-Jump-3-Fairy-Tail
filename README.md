Doodle Jump 3 is a woodlands-themed platforming video game in which you guide Doodle up a series of neverending platforms to constantly beat your high score. The code was developed as the final project for CS 3 - Introduction to Software Engineering at Caltech.

### Game Progression
The game progresses as the Doodle (which is controlled by the player) continuously jumps higher using various platforms on the screen and avoiding enemies that can hurt him. The objective of the game is to get as high as possible without falling or dying. The game also gets progressively harder (e.g. less platforms, more enemies) as Doodle gets higher.
### Win and Loss Conditions
There is no win condition because the objective of the game is to get as high as possible in a single run. However, a run ends when Doodle falls off the screen after missing the platforms or if Doodle hits an enemy.
### Levels/Points
There are no levels in this game, and the game is instead organized by runs or attempts in which the player tries to beat their previous best. Each run has a score that is based on the height the player achieves before falling/dying.
### Controls
Although Doodle automatically jumps on surfaces, the player can control where it moves by using the left and right arrow keys. They can also drag their mouse to aim at enemies, using left-click to shoot.
### Physics
The game includes a physics engine that creates conditions for gravity, collisions, and a magnetic force.
### Game Flow
When the player opens up the game, they will first see a start screen with a “play” button, a record of their high score, as well as “settings'' and “shop” buttons. After they hit “play,” a jumping Doodle will appear on a grassy platform, with other raised platforms nearby. The player can then use the arrow keys to direct Doodle from platform to platform, shooting at enemies when needed. They can also let Doodle pick up power-ups, such as a pair of fairy wings (boost), shield (immunity against enemies), and magnet (draws stars toward Doodle). When Doodle fails to reach a platform, the platforms below it disappear and Doodle falls back to the ground. A “play again” button will appear on the screen to allow the player to restart the game to beat their high score. Alternatively, they can press a “home” button to return to the start screen and access their settings and the shop. The settings will include options to turn the score marker, sounds, and power-ups on or off. Additionally, the shop page will include options to exchange the stars collected throughout their games for extra power-ups such as fairy wings that will allow the player to start the next game with a boost or a bag of pixie dust that gives Doodle a second life in the next game.
